# igit
Igit is a repository, like git, but with extra stupidity!

Compared to some other systems, igit allows for more details about how the parts of a project fit together, their historical development and relationships.

The code is not yet ready for release, but a jar file and user manual is available. 

To execute, use

    java -cp igit.jar igit.impl.Main

followed by any arguments to the program, as specified in the user manual.
